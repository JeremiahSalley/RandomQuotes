# Day2 of 100Days of Code RandomQuotes

## Random Quote Generator 
Today I build upon my skill from day 1 Modal and took the same concept and expained upon it 
I knew I want to have four buttons that when clicked a random quote would pop up on the middle of the screen.

### Take Away for the day
- Arrays 
- Math.floor()
- Math.Random()
